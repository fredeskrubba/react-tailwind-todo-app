📒 Notebook & To-Do Application

This project is a personal productivity application that combines note-taking and task management in a single, simple interface. The goal of the app is to provide an easy way to organize ideas, notes, and daily tasks without unnecessary complexity.

The frontend is built with React and Tailwind CSS, focusing on a clean, responsive user experience. The backend is implemented using ASP.NET Core, with MariaDB used as the persistent data store.

🔐 Authentication & Access

User accounts are created manually by the developer.
If you do not have an account, the application provides a Guest access mode.

Guest users can:

Use all core features of the application

Create and manage notes and to-do items

Have their data stored temporarily

For privacy and system cleanliness, all guest data is automatically and permanently deleted after 12 hours.

If you require a permanent account, you must contact the developer to have one created.
